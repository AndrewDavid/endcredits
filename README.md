#End Credits in jQuery

###Version 2.0

Movie end credits for your website!

Based on [original version](https://github.com/Malkafly/endcredits) by Daniel Malkafly.

---

Basically re-wrote everything. Still using the same html from the original as the example though.

Changes from original version listed below:

```
+ complete re-write
+ hold mouse button down for one second to speed up scrolling
^ animation time dynamically calculated based on credits height
^ css: credits text is unselectable
^ css: titles is now fixed position and full screen
* credits reset their position properly after closing
```
